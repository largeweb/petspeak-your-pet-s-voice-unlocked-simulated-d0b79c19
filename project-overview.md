# Project Overview

Project Name: PetSpeak - Your Pet's Voice, Unlocked (Simulated!)

Description: Ever wonder what your furry friend is *really* trying to tell you? PetSpeak is a web app that *simulates* understanding your pet's needs. Analyze "barks" and "meows", decode tail wags and purrs, and get tailored care tips â€“ all within a fun, user-friendly interface. Note: This is a *mocked* AI experience.

Features:

*   Simulated Sound Analysis: "Record" your pet's sounds and get a humorous "translation" (e.g., "That's a demand for more treats!").
*   Body Language Decoder: Select your pet's posture, tail position, and ear angle to reveal their mood (e.g., "Ears forward, tail wagging? Pure excitement!").
*   Personalized Care Tips: Based on the "translation" and "body language," receive lighthearted care advice (e.g., "Your dog is bored! Time for a walk!").
*   Multi-Pet Profiles: Create profiles for all your furry, scaly, or feathered friends.

Target Audience: Pet owners who want a fun, lighthearted way to connect with their animals.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
